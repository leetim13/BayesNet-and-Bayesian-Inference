# BayesNet-and-Bayesian-Inference
Implemented variable elimination for any given Bayes Net. Used the net for problem-solving and inference.

### Example:
`carDiagnosis.py`: specifies a Bayes Net for diagnosing various reasons why a car might not start, with various CPTs for the net. For example, the variable `BatteryVoltage` (which is the variable `bv` in the file `carDiagnosis.py`) can take on one of three different values: `“strong”, “weak” and “dead”.`
